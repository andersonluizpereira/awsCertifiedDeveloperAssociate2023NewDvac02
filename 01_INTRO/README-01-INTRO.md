Cloud Computing, or cloud computing, refers to the delivery of computing services, such as storage, processing, networking, analytics, software and intelligence, over the Internet ("cloud") to provide faster, more flexible and scalable resources. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a leading cloud service provider, offering a wide range of services that enable organizations and individuals to run applications and store data in the cloud.

Here are some of the main concepts related to the definition of Cloud Computing on AWS:

1. **On-Demand Resources:** Users can obtain compute and storage resources as needed, paying only for what they use. This eliminates the need for upfront investment in infrastructure.

2. **Internet Access:** Services are accessed via the Internet, providing flexibility in accessing resources from anywhere in the world.

3. **Elasticity and Scalability:** Users can scale resources up or down depending on demand. This allows you to handle traffic spikes or reduce costs during slower periods.

4. **Managed Services:** AWS offers managed services, which means that many of the administrative tasks, such as hardware maintenance and software updates, are handled by AWS, allowing users to focus on their applications and data.

5. **Shared Responsibility Model:** AWS follows the shared responsibility model, where it manages the security of the cloud (infrastructure, data centers, etc.), while customers are responsible for the security of their data in the cloud ( user accounts, access settings, etc.).

6. **Diverse Services:** AWS offers a variety of services, including compute (EC2), storage (S3), databases (RDS), data analysis (Redshift), machine learning (SageMaker), among others.

7. **Flexibility and Agility:** Cloud Computing allows users to quickly experiment with new ideas and implement solutions in a more agile way compared to traditional infrastructures.

8. **Pay Per Use:** Customers pay for the resources they consume, which provides significant cost savings compared to purchasing their own infrastructure.

In short, Cloud Computing on AWS offers a more efficient, flexible, and cost-effective approach to delivering IT resources, enabling organizations of all sizes to innovate and grow more effectively.

### AWS Global Infrastructure
* AWS Regions
* AWS Avalability Zones
* AWS Data Centers
* AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence

* https://infrastructure.aws

    

# How to choose an AWS Region ?
* Complince -> With Data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
* Proximity -> To customers: reduce latency
* Avalability Services -> Within a region: new services and new features arent`s available in every region
* Pricing -> Princing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
